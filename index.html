        <section>The Core Commitments

            <section>
                I commit to engage when present
            </section>

            <section><p>I commit to to know and disclose</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment">what I want</li>
                    <li class="fragment">what I think</li>
                    <li class="fragment">and what I feel</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                I will personally support the best idea
            </section>
            <section>
                I will seek to perceive more than I seek to be perceived
            </section>

            <section>
                I will use teams, especially when undertaking difficult tasks
            </section>

            <section>
                I will speak always and only when I believe it will improve the general results/effort ratio
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>I will disengage from less productive situations</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment">When I cannot keep these commitments</li>
                    <li class="fragment"> When it is more important that I engage elsewhere</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                I will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing my behavior toward action
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>Pass & Unpass
            <section>
                The Pass protocol is how you decline to participate in something. Use it anytime you donâ€™t want to
                participate in an activity.
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>Check In
            <section>Use Check In to begin meetings or anytime an individual or group Check In would add more value to
                the current team interactions.
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>Check Out
            <section>Check Out requires that your physical presence always signifies your engagement. You must Check Out
                when you are aware that you cannot maintain the Core Commitments or whenever it would be better for you
                to be elsewhere.
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>Decider
            <section>
                Use Decider anytime you want to move a group immediately and unanimously towards results.
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>Resolution
            <section>When a Decider vote yields a small minority of outliers, the proposer quickly leads the team, in a
                highly structured fashion, to deal with the outliers. The Resolution protocol promotes forward momentum
                by focusing on bringing outliers in at least cost.
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>Investigate
            <section>Investigate allows you to learn about a phenomenon that occurs in someone else. Use it when an idea
                or behavior someone is presenting seems poor, confusing, or simply interesting.
