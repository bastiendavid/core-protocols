                <h2>(⛔)</h2></section>

            </section>
        </section>

        <section>Resolution
            <section><h1>👍 👍 👍</h1></section>
            <section>When a Decider vote yields a small minority of outliers, the proposer quickly leads the team, in a
                highly structured fashion, to deal with the outliers. The Resolution protocol promotes forward momentum
                by focusing on bringing outliers in at least cost.

        </section>

        <section>Ask For Help
            <section><h1>🙋‍♀️ 🙋‍♂️</h1></section>
            <section>The Ask For Help protocol allows you to efficiently make use of the skills and knowledge of others.

                aren’t expecting a positive outcome resulting from the current behavior. Intention Check assesses the
                integrity of your own and another’s intention in a given case.

        </section>

        <section>Personal Alignment
            <section><h1>🧗‍♀️</h1></section>
            <section>The Personal Alignment protocol helps you penetrate deeply into your desires and find what’s
                blocking you from getting what you want. Use it to discover, articulate, and achieve what you want. The
                quality of your alignment will be equal to the quality of your results.
